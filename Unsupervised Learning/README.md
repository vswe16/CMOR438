# Unsupervised Learning 

## Overview 

Unsupervised learning algorithms operate on datasets without labeled outputs. Instead of learning a mapping from inputs to known targets, unsupervised algorithms aim to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structure in the data itself. This makes unsupervised learning especially valuable for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction, especially when labeled data is scarce or unavailable. It complements supervised learning by revealing insights that might otherwise go unnoticed and by helping to shape and preprocess data for predictive modeling.
The two primary tasks in unsupervised learning are clustering and dimensionality reduction. Clustering involves grouping data points based on similarity or distance metrics, with popular algorithms including k-means and hierarchical clustering. These methods are widely used in applications like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image grouping. Dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, seeks to reduce the number of input variables while retaining important information. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are commonly used to visualize high-dimensional data or prepare it for supervised models.
Unlike supervised learning, which is driven by explicit feedback in the form of labels, unsupervised learning is inherently data-driven and self-organizing. This makes evaluation more challenging, as there are no "correct" labels to compare against. Instead, metrics like silhouette score, inertia, or domain-specific heuristics are used to assess model performance. Nevertheless, its utility in real-world scenarios is significantâ€”unsupervised learning can uncover subpopulations within datasets, detect outliers or fraudulent behavior, and help compress data.
