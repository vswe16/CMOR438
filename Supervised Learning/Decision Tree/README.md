Decision Trees are non-linear models that split the feature space into regions based on decision rules inferred from the data. They build a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature test, branches represent decision outcomes, and leaves correspond to predicted outputs. Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Their interpretability makes them useful for understanding decision logic, and they naturally handle both numerical and categorical features. However, they can overfit the training data if not pruned or regularized properly.
