# Supervised Learning 

## Overview 

Supervised learning is a class of machine learning algorithms which learn from labeled datasets—datasets where each input example is paired with a corresponding output or target value. The goal is to train a model that can generalize from the training data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen examples. This approach is fundamental in predictive modeling tasks and is used widely across domains such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and more.
Supervised learning tasks generally fall into two categories: regression and classification. Regression problems involve predicting continuous numerical values—such as forecasting stock prices, estimating housing costs, or modeling temperature trends. In contrast, classification problems involve predicting discrete labels, such as determining whether an email is spam, diagnosing a disease based on symptoms, or identifying objects in an image. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), each with different strengths depending on the structure and complexity of the data.
An essential component of supervised learning is model evaluation, which uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC for classification tasks, or mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared for regression. These metrics assess how well a model performs not just on training data but on validation and test datasets. 
Compared to unsupervised learning, which explores the structure of unlabeled data to find patterns or groupings, supervised learning is more targeted. It requires prior knowledge in the form of labeled outcomes, making it well-suited to problems where the objective is known and quantifiable. While unsupervised learning is often used for exploration and preprocessing, supervised learning is central to building applicable predictive systems.
