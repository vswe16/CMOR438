# Linear Regression 

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in supervised learning, used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables

X and the target

It also serves as a foundation for more advanced regression techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression.
