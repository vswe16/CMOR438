# Random Forest 

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features (bagging), and predictions are made by aggregating the results, through majority vote for classification or averaging for regression. Random forests are highly robust and can handle high-dimensional data with minimal preprocessing.
